# Git & GitHub Learning Repository

This repository documents our group’s learning journey while auditing Google’s
“Introduction to Git and GitHub” course on Coursera.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical understanding of Git,
GitHub, and collaborative workflows through consistent commits, structured notes,
and hands-on exercises aligned with each course module.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized in course modules. Each module contains folders for
individual contributors as well as shared demonstration files where applicable.

## Collaboration Workflow
- **Modules 1–2:** Direct commits to `main` within individual folders.
- **Module 3:** Introduction of remote repositories and occasional branching.
- **Module 4:** Branch-based development using pull requests, code reviews, and
  controlled merges into `main`.

This workflow evolves to mirror the concepts taught in the course.
