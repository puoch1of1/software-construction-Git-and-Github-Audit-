# Git & GitHub Learning Repository

This repository documents our group’s learning journey while auditing Google’s
“Introduction to Git and GitHub” course on Coursera.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical understanding of Git,
GitHub, and collaborative workflows through consistent commits, structured notes,
and hands-on exercises aligned with each course module.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized in course modules and each module contains folders for
individual contributors as well as shared demonstration files where applicable.

## Collaboration Workflow
Each contributor works on their own branch and submits pull requests to merge
into `main`. We do not commit directly to `main`, and we do not use individual
folders that commit to `main`.

This workflow mirrors the course’s branch-based collaboration model.
