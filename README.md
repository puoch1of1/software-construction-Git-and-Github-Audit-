# Git & GitHub Collaborative Learning Repository

## Overview
This repository documents our group’s learning journey while studying Git and GitHub through both the **Google "Introduction to Git and GitHub" Coursera course** and the **W3Schools Git Tutorial**.

The repository serves as a practical workspace where we apply version control concepts through structured notes, exercises, and collaborative development workflows.

## Purpose
This repository is used to:

- Demonstrate practical understanding of Git and GitHub concepts  
- Practice real-world collaborative development workflows  
- Track individual and group contributions through commits and pull requests  
- Document lecture summaries, exercises, and learning reflections  
- Build confidence using distributed version control systems  

## Contributors
- Absolom Orianga  
- Travis Mark Lufene  
- Mubiru Humphery  
- Puoch Mabor Makuei  
- Sebatta Allan Kagimu  

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by course modules. Each contributor works on a
personal branch, committing lecture summaries and any complementary code
samples, then merges changes into `main` via pull requests.

## Collaboration Workflow
Each contributor works on their own branch and submits pull requests to merge
into `main`. We do not commit directly to `main`, and we do not use individual
folders that commit to `main`.

This workflow mirrors the course’s branch-based collaboration model.
