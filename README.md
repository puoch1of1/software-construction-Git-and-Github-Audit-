# Git & GitHub Collaborative Learning Repository

## Overview
This repository documents our group’s learning journey while studying Git and GitHub through both the **Google "Introduction to Git and GitHub" Coursera course** and the **W3Schools Git Tutorial**.

The repository serves as a practical workspace where we apply version control concepts through structured notes, exercises, and collaborative development workflows.

## Purpose
This repository is used to:

- Demonstrate practical understanding of Git and GitHub concepts  
- Practice real-world collaborative development workflows  
- Track individual and group contributions through commits and pull requests  
- Document lecture summaries, exercises, and learning reflections  
- Build confidence using distributed version control systems  

## Contributors
- Absolom Orianga  
- Travis Mark Lufene  
- Mubiru Humphery  
- Puoch Mabor Makuei  
- Sebatta Allan Kagimu  

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized according to learning modules and exercises from both learning platforms. Contributors submit:

- Lecture and tutorial summaries  
- Practical exercises  
- Supporting code samples where applicable  
- Notes and documentation related to Git concepts  

## Collaboration Workflow
To encourage proper version control practices and transparency in contribution tracking:

- Each contributor works on their **own branch**
- Work is committed regularly with clear commit messages
- Changes are submitted through **Pull Requests**
- Pull Requests are reviewed before merging into `main`
- Direct commits to `main` are avoided to maintain repository stability

This workflow mirrors industry-standard collaborative development practices.

## Tools and Platforms Used
- Git  
- GitHub  
- Google Coursera – Introduction to Git and GitHub  
- W3Schools Git Tutorial  
- Code Editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

## Learning Outcome
By completing both learning platforms and practicing collaboratively in this repository, the group aims to:

- Understand Git architecture and workflows  
- Apply branching and merging strategies effectively  
- Use GitHub collaboration tools such as pull requests and reviews  
- Develop industry-ready version control skills  
- Strengthen teamwork and collaborative software development practices  

## Notes
This repository functions as a shared learning log and collaborative workspace where progress, participation, and understanding of Git concepts can be clearly demonstrated.
