Lecture Summary

This course focuses on version control, which is about tracking changes in code and configuration files over time. Instead of only writing code, it teaches how to manage different versions, recover from mistakes, and collaborate effectively using version control systems. The main tool introduced is Git, along with GitHub for hosting remote repositories and working with others.

By the end of the course, the goal is to confidently store code history in Git and collaborate through GitHub, while also building a personal GitHub portfolio. This portfolio is important because many employers use it to evaluate practical skills and past work when hiring for IT roles.

The course also explains why version control is critical in real-world projects. In team environments, a VCS helps engineers work in parallel, track revisions, roll back problematic changes, and stay aligned while executing complex projects. Collaboration, not just individual coding, is a major focus.

Throughout the course, we learn both basic and advanced Git features such as commits, branching, merging, and working with remote repositories. The examples use Python scripts and Linux command-line tools, so having basic knowledge of Python, Linux commands, and Python 3 installed is helpful. Overall, the course builds Git skills step by step and emphasizes patience, practice, and real-world application.
