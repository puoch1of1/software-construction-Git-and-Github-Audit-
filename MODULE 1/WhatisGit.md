GIT LECTURE SUMMARY

Git is a version control system created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel. It was designed to handle large, complex projects with many contributors working from different locations, after existing tools failed to meet performance and workflow needs. Git is free, open source, and works across major operating systems including Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Unlike centralized version control systems, Git uses a distributed architecture, meaning every contributor has a complete copy of the repository and its history on their own machine. This allows most operations to run quickly and even without a network connection. While teams often use a shared server as a collaboration hub, Git does not depend on a central server to function.

Git can operate both as a client and a server and supports communication over HTTP, SSH, or its own protocol. It is flexible enough to support solo projects as well as massive projects with thousands of contributors, and it can be used for private work or shared publicly through platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

Although Git is sometimes referred to as an SCM (Source Control Management) tool, it is more accurately described as a VCS because it can track more than just source code, including configuration and documentation. The course focuses on Git due to its popularity, performance, and wide support, while also acknowledging that alternative version control systems like Subversion and Mercurial exist.
