# Git Basics – Core Concepts & First Repository

## Why Configure Git?
Git is a **Version Control System (VCS)** that tracks **who** made changes.  
To enable this, you must tell Git your identity (name and email).

### Set Global User Configuration
These settings are attached to every commit you make.

Run the following commands in your terminal (Git Bash, Command Prompt, or PowerShell):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
