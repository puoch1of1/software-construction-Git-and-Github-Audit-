**Applying Changes** refers to the process of sharing and updating code efficiently by focusing only on what has been modified rather than replacing entire files. Developers use tools like `diff` to compare two versions of a file and generate a patch (or diff) file that highlights the exact changes along with useful context. These changes can then be automatically applied to the original code using the `patch` command, reducing manual editing and minimizing errors. This approach improves collaboration, maintains clear version history, and is especially useful in large projects where multiple files and directories may be updated, ensuring that modifications are structured, traceable, and easier to integrate.
